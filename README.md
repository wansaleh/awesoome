# The *Awesome* Awesome List viewer

I wanted a searchable, beautiful viewer of the awesome initiative started by [sindresorhus](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome). Then comes [Awesoome](http://awesoo.me).

## Poi
Built using the excellent [Poi](https://poi.js.org). IMHO the best no-config development kit.
Now you can forget or even be ignorant about webpack. ðŸ˜œ
Deal with it. ðŸ˜Ž

## Usage
1.	I implore you to use yarn instead of npm. It's faster. Will save you hours.

	On Mac:
	```shell
	brew install yarn
	```
	Other platforms:

	[Install instructions here](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/)

2.	Clone this repo & initialize it as your own.
	```shell
    git clone git@github.com:wansaleh/poi-react-starter.git
    cd poi-react-starter
    rm -rf .git
    ```

3.	Install all deps.
	```shell
    yarn
    ```

4.	Run the thing.
	```shell
    poi
    ```
